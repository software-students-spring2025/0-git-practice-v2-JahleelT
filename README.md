- The software engineering related article I find interesting,  is linked [here](https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to?source=post_page-----56b0d9de2c43--------------------------------).

## Thoughts on Article
- What I find to be most interesting about the article is the manner in which it is written. The author follows a format of "Do *action a*, but if not *action a*, then do *action b*," going down the list of actions to write better, more efficient code. The author does this a total of three times before essentially saying that you sometimes will just be writing a large amount of code rather than making use of boilerplate or an API. 
- I have also heard before that one of the reasons that certain outdated coding languages exist is because of how much more expensive it is to go back and rewrite the same code in a newer language. This made it more understandable that the author refers to lines of code as debt; you are going to want to write as little code as possible.
